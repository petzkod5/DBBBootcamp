The system should also be able to track Rooms. 
Rooms should have a status and an associated tavern. 
There should be a way to track Room Stays which will contain a sale, guest, room, the date it was stayed in and the rate


Write a query that returns guests with a birthday before 2000.
Write a query to return rooms that cost more than 100 gold a night
Write a query that returns UNIQUE guest names. 
Write a query that returns all guests ordered by name (ascending) Use ASC or DESC after your ORDER BY [col]
Write a query that returns the top 10 highest price sales
Write a query to return all the values stored in all Lookup Tables - Lookup tables are the tables we reference typically with just an ID and a name. 

This should be a dynamic combining of all of the tables
Write a query that returns Guest Classes with Levels and Generate a new column with a label for their level grouping (lvl 1-10, 10-20, etc)

Write a series of INSERT commands that will insert the statuses of one table into another of your choosing using SELECT statements 
(See our lab in class - The INSERT commands should be generated). 
It’s ok if the data doesn’t match or make sense! :)

Remember, INSERT Commands look like: INSERT INTO Table1 (column1, column2) VALUES (column1, column2)
Ex. INSERT INTO ROLES (Name) VALUES (Active)
      INSERT INTO ROLES (Name) VALUES (Inactive)
