Complete the User story: 
There should be a way to track guests- their names, notes about them, birthdays, cakedays, and status - which can be any kind. Such as sick, fine, hangry, raging, placid. 

The guests should have classes and should have levels related to them. Ex. lvl 2 mage, lvl 3 fighter. ((linking table)).

Also I no longer want to track rats.

Finish up our Schema with missing information - We need to link Supplies and have them be used in sales. 
Create a Supply Sales table to give us a way to make use of received supplies. (You can alternatively create a ServiceSupplies table or even a SaleSupplies table and 
make use of the supplies in Services that Taverns sell)

Add Foreign Keys and Primary Keys to our tables. 

Take care when creating the primary keys for the many-to-many relationships.
Instead of Adding Foreign Keys and Primary keys to a table on creation, Use an Alter Table command to modify the table to add them to the Tavern table and the User TableShow that 
there are constraints by making insertions or queries that will fail due to foreign key constraints (you can comment these out so that your script still runs)
